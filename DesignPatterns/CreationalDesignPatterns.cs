        //Creational Design Patterns provide ways to instantiate a single object or group of related objects. 
        //These patterns deal with the process of object creation in such way that they are separated from their implementing system.
        //That provides more flexibility in deciding which object needs to be created or instantiated for a given scenario.
        // There are the following five such patterns.
        // abstract Factory
        // factor
        // singlton
        // builder
        // prototype
    }
