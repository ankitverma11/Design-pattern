        //Design patterns provide general solutions or flexible way to solve common design problems.
        //Design Patterns in the object oriented world is reusable solution to common software design problems that occur repeatedly in real-world application development. 

        //"A pattern is a recurring solution to a problem in a context."
        //Patterns are used by developers for their specific design to solve their problems.

//        These 23 patterns are grouped into three main categories based on their:

     //Creational Design Pattern
        //Factory Method
        //Abstract Factory
        //Builder
        //Prototype
        //Singleton

        //Structural Design Patterns
           //Adapter
            //Bridge
            //Composite
            //Decorator
            //Façade
            //Flyweight
            //Proxy
            //Behavioral Design Patterns

              //Chain of Responsibility
                //Command
                //Interpreter
                //Iterator
                //Mediator
                //Memento
                //Observer
                //State
                //Strategy
                //Visitor
                //Template Method
